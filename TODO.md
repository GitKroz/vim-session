To-do list

 * Test and document the experimental `:RestartVim` command!
 * Try to find a more or less generic solution to restoring buffers with content generated at runtime by Vim plug-ins like the [NERD tree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) and [Tag List](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273).
 * Provide `:LockSession` and `:UnlockSession` commands?
